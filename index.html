          school in Seattle, where he befriends Paul Allen. The two students

          classes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1973</strong>
          - Gates enters Harvard as a pre-law major, but soon shifts focus. He
          quickly runs through the university’s most rigorous mathematics and

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>

        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>1990</strong>
          - The Federal Trade Commission begins an investigation into possible
          collusion between IBM and Microsoft.The FTC charges that IBM and
          Microsoft collaborated to divvy up the market for operating systems in

          market and Microsoft’s Windows covering the low-end of the market.

          Foundation.

        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>1995</strong>
          - In July, at age 39 and with a fortune of $12.9 billion, Gates
          becomes the world’s richest man. Later that summer, Microsoft
          introduces Internet Explorer to the world, as part of Windows 95. The
          Road Ahead, Gates’ book about his vision for the digital future, holds
          the No. 1 spot on The New York Times best-seller list for seven weeks.
          Gates begins to shift Microsoft’s focus toward the emerging Internet.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>1998</strong>
          - In Belgium, on his way to meet business and government leaders,
          Gates is hit in the face with a cream pie. The incident was
          orchestrated by Noel Godin, a Belgian who gained notoriety for
          throwing pies at high-profile individuals. Godin was quoted saying the
          incident was an act “against hierarchical power.” In May, the U.S.
          Justice Department charges Microsoft with engaging in anticompetitive
          and exclusionary practices designed to maintain its monopoly in
          personal computer operating systems and to extend that monopoly to
          Internet browsing software. Twenty state attorneys general and the
          District of Columbia filed a similar action. Later, in October the DOJ
          also sued Microsoft for violating a 1994 consent decree, by forcing
          computer makers to include its Internet browser as a part of the
          installation of Windows software.
        </li>

          - Gates publishes another best-selling book, Business @ the Speed of
          Thought, about the interconnectedness of business and technology. That
          year he begins appearing more and more in pop culture. The television
          network TNT airs a made-for-TV movie about the emergence of Apple and
          Microsoft called Pirates of Silicon Valley. Anthony Michael Hall, who
          played the nerd Brian in The Breakfast Club, plays Gates.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2000</strong>
          - Gates steps down as CEO of Microsoft. Gates’ former Harvard
          dorm-mate and right-hand man Steve Ballmer takes over the helm, while
          Gates becomes chief software architect. The Bill & Melinda Gates
          Foundation is formed, merging the William H. Gates Foundation and the
          Gates Learning Foundation. Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield
          Jackson concludes Microsoft misused its monopoly power, and orders the
          company be split in twoparts, one to produce the operating system and
          the other to produce other software components.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2001</strong>
          - Judge Penfield’s 2000 decision is overturned on appeal. The DOJ
          announces that it is no longer seeking to break up Microsoft and will
          instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty. An agreement is reached
          between the DOJ and Microsoft on Nov. 2. MGM releases the movie
          Antitrust, starring Tim Robbins, about a company and character loosely
          based on Microsoft and Bill Gates.

          contributions to the United Kingdom. Time names him a “Person of the
          Year,” along with Melinda Gates and Bono, for what the magazine called
          his “good Samaritan” work.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2006</strong>
          -Gates announces that his role as an executive at Microsoft will be
          phased out over the following two years. His intention, he says, is to
          spend more time working with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

          most of his fortune, to the foundation.

          - Gates “graduates” from Harvard; the university awards him with an
          honorary degree. Gates gives the commencement speech, encouraging the
          graduates to strive for social change. “Humanity’s greatest advances
          are not in its discoveries,” Gates says to the class, “but in how
          those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.”
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong>
          - Though his fortune continues to grow, Gates loses his spot as the
          richest man on the planet. After 13 years in the No. 1 spot on the
          Forbes’ list, Gates’ is surpassed by his friend Warren Buffet and
          Mexican telecom giant Carlos Slim Helu. Gates retires from day-to-day
          duties at Microsoft on June 27, but stays in the role of chairman and
          adviser on important development projects. He tells the Seattle
          Post-Intelligencer that he plans to pour the same amount of energy
          into his foundation that he did into Microsoft. He tells the
          newspaper, “I’m not a sit-on-the-beach type.
